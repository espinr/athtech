		 <h1>About the Athtech conferences</h1>

		 <p>The AthTech series started from humble beginnings in 2016.
		 	OpenTrack and European Athletics applied to add a one-day track
		 	to the Open Data Conference in Madrid.  There was a clear gap
		 	for people dealing with athletics technology - federations, 
		 	statisticians, service providers, vendors and amateur athletes - 
		 	to come together.</p>

		 <p>In addition to a conference, there's an ongoing 
		 	<a href="https://www.w3.org/community/opentrack/">World Wide Web
		 	Consortium working group</a> which meets regularly, committed to
		 	interoperability and standards across the sport.
