      <p>The AthTech conference series aims to help Athletics move forwards, with a strong focus on sports data management and interoperability among stakeholders (federations, event organisers, clubs, timekeeping providers, training-devices makers, data experts, journalists, among others). <a href="http://www.european-athletics.org/">European Athletics</a> has been working on a digital strategy for the sport, building a common infrastructure to guarantee universal interoperability among all stakeholders. This strategy will be presented and enhanced through the different interactive sessions, strategically organised to cover all challenges proposed by the attendees.</p>   

      <p>This conference is open to anyone interested in <strong>any topic related to technology and sports</strong>.</p>

      <h2 class="second">Objective</h2>

      <blockquote>Shape the future of Athletics</blockquote>

      <p>Any and all technologies relating to Athletics are candidates for discussion.  We hope to bring the key people
      together, so that federations, firms and individuals can see what is available, and also pool resources to
      build better solutions together - where possible, driven by shared collaboration, open data, and Open Standards.</p>


      <h2 class="second">Topics</h2>

      <p>The conference will focus on sports data management in general, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Competition management data;</li>
        <li>An open reference database for the sport;</li>
        <li>Data visualization and storytelling;</li>
        <li>Economics of athletics</li>
        <li>Fan engagement through social media;</li>
        <li>Streaming solutions;</li>
        <li>Sports statistics;</li>
        <li>Data processing;</li>
        <li>Timekeeping technologies;</li>
        <li>...and whatever related to <strong>technologies + sports</strong>.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Check <a href="/2023/agenda">the agenda</a> and feel free to <a href="mailto://athtech@opentrack.run">send us your suggestions</a>. The program will evolve between now and the conference.</p>


      <h2 class="second">Mission</h2>

      <blockquote>Standards for Athletics</blockquote>

      <p>Standard infrastructure for Athletics data management will enable a common mechanism to gain effectiveness and efficiency in the process of collecting and sharing data on a global scale. We will be able to: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>federate resources in an automatic way;</li>
        <li>establish universal identifiers for athletes, clubs, and other entities;</li> 
        <li>access better reports;</li> 
        <li>track competition issues, and records;</li>
        <li>have centralised up-to-date rankings;</li> 
        <li>create and publish live results; </li>
        <li>create new services and products on top of the data.</li>
      </ul>


      <p>The common Athletics infrastructure follows the open data paradigm, encouraging the publication of data in standard formats and under permissive re-use licenses. This will bring us successful services and innovative products —made by federations or by third parties— that will affect the sport in a positive way.</p>

      <h2 class="second">Audience</h2>

      <p>AthTech is open to anyone. Among the attendees there will be:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Athletics federations;</li>
        <li>data management experts;</li>
        <li>event organisers;</li>
        <li>training-device makers;</li>
        <li>sports clubs;</li>
        <li>sports services providers</li>
        <li>sports enthusiasts, and others.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Registration is via the <a href="https://data.opentrack.run/en-gb/x/2023/MLT/athtech/">OpenTrack Entry System</a>. 100 places are available. </p>

        <p><i>This is a competition entry system, so please understand if it feels a little unusual for a conference! However previous attendees and most European Federations have logins.</i></p>
