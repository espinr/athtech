<br>Athletics is the best sport in the world, so how do we keep the fan base engaged? What technology could make the experience even better?
<br><i>Chaired by Andy Robinson (OpenTrack)</i>
<ul>
<li>Social media - best strategies for communication.</li>
<li>Technology - How can we show the physicality of our athletes to a young audience. Live splits, instantaneous speeds, javelin attack angles, etc.</li>
</ul>
<br>
We invite any attendees with stories to tell of successful social media and new engagement channels - please get in touch and prepare short talks, and we'll list you here!

<div class='content'>

<p>Non-Fungible Tokens are perhaps the biggest new thing in sports marketing in 2021.  Well established in the arts, NFTs are allowing
professional sports like the NBA to "capture the moment" and monetize it, letting fans own a slice of the memories.  We will explore
how this might apply to athletics with two expert organisations speaking.</p>
