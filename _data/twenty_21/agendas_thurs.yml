  info: "<p><b>The future of communicating with fans</b>
<br>Moderated by <a href=https://twitter.com/philminshull>Phil Minshull</a>, Editorial Consultant to European Athletics, this session explores how to improve the fan experience. 
<br>Athletics is the best sport in the world, so how do we keep the fan base engaged? What technology could make the experience even better?
<ul><li>Social media - best strategies for communication.</li>
<li>Technology - How can we show the physicality of our athletes to a young audience. Live splits, instantaneous speeds, javelin attack angles, etc.</li>
<li>IsoLynx and live split capture</li>
<li>NFTs - attaching value to digital assets - Fabrice Doreau, Duje Bonacci</li>
</ul>

<p>Any federation doing good things with social media is invited to make contact and give a brief presentation</p>
