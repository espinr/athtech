      <blockquote>Breakthrough technologies in a handicap relay race where strategy is key.</blockquote>

      
      

      <p>AthTech Run is a <i>polylauf <a href="#polylauf">*</a></i> relay race where teams will be composed of different number of athletes depending on their gender and age, bringing an exciting and fair competition among 15 teams.</p>

      <p>This competition will serve as a <strong>technology showcase</strong>. At the race, training device makers, timekeeping service providers, data processing experts, will exhibit their products and services that will enhance the show.</p>   

      <p class="note" id="#polylauf" style="padding-left: 2rem; font-style: italic; font-size: 80%;">
          <strong>*</strong> The <i>polylauf</i> was invented by Richard Holt of Kingston AC & Polytechnic Harriers, London, whose club has used it as a pre-Christmas fun competition for many years. It's generalised from <i><a href="http://www.athleticsweekly.com/0/admin/coaching/endurance-paarlauf/">paarlauf</a></i>, a German word for a two-person relay
      </p>

      <h2 class="second">Teams</h2>


      <p>We don't want to offend anyone by differentiating team members by gender and age. So, in order to make the competition more challenging and thrilling for spectators, teams will have different number of components:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>5 Senior Male Teams</strong>: ðŸ‘¤ðŸ‘¤ (â¨‰2) men of any age</li>
        <li><strong>5 Senior Female Teams</strong>: ðŸ‘¤ðŸ‘¤ðŸ‘¤ (â¨‰3) women of any age</li>
        <li><strong>5 Youth Teams</strong>: ðŸ‘¤ðŸ‘¤ðŸ‘¤ðŸ‘¤(â¨‰4) U16 boys and girls</li>
        <li><strong>Veteran Teams</strong>: ðŸ‘¤ðŸ‘¤ðŸ‘¤(â¨‰3) Master attending the AthTech Conference</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2 class="second">Rules</h2>

      <ul>
          <li>The race is free of charge for participants and spectators.</li>
          <li>The race will be held at El KilometrÃ­n, a popular 1 kilometer ring visited by hundreds of athletes every day. It has a soil surface with grassy areas around, easy to reach for spectators.</li>
          <li>15 teams will be invited to take part in the competition.</li>
          <li>Every team must complete 10 laps to El KilometrÃ­n (10 km in total).</li>
          <li>Both start and finish lines will be properly marked.</li>
          <li>During the competition, only an athlete per team will be allowed on the track.</li>
          <li>The rest of the team components must be within the changeover areas.<br>
            <figure>

            </figure>
          </li>
          <li>There will be four (4) changeover areas (marked with traffic cones, flags or similar) where all relays must be performed.<br>
            <img style="max-width: 80%;" src="/css/2018_style/img/run/changeover_area.png" alt="changeover area separated by traffic cones"/></li>
         <li>The changeover areas <strong>are located at: 0, 200m, 450m, 650m and 1000m, approximately from the start/finish line.</strong></li>
          <li>Relays must be performed <strong>within any</strong> of the changeover zones.</li>
          <li>Relays are correctly performed with the contact of two athletes of the same team (preferably touching hands).</li>
          <li>Changeover areas are connected by paths (on the grass of the inner part of the ring) where athletes may move freely.</li>
          <li>Officials will control that the relay is performed correctly.</li>
          <li>Officials may disqualify teams if any of their athletes does not follow these rules.</li>
          <li>Senior teams (male/female) must appoint captains to represent teams.</li>
          <li>Teams must select their own strategy and organise the order of relays.</li>
          <li>Youth Teams must have a coach (adult) to represent and coordinate them.</li>
          <li>Only fair play will be accepted.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="second">Prizes</h2>
      <p>AthTech Run is a handicap race, so there will be only one category where all teams will be included.</p>
      <p>There will be trophies for specific challenges to be measured during the event (e.g., fastest lap, average lap time, etc.).</p>
