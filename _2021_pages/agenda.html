      <p>Below is the agenda for AthTech21.  The agenda is "built by the participants" - we hope
        many of you will give full or mini-presentations on the themes, and tell us what is happening
        in your country or with your products.   It should therefore develop in detail rapidly.
        Please email <a href="mailto:athtech@opentrack.run">athtech@opentrack.run</a> if you have something to share, and we will add you here!

        </p>
        <p>We also have extensive space for workshops and small meetings the days before and after the main
            meeting</p>
