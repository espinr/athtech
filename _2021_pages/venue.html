          University of Zadar<br>

      <h4>Conference venues</h4>
      <p>The conference will be held on these two locations:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>V1 - <a href="https://www.unizd.hr/eng/about-us/where-are-we">Zadar University New Campus</a></li>
        <li>V2 - <a href="https://visnjik.hr/sportski-centar-visnjik/">Višnjik Sports Center</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>Being one of the Zadar University locations with all the lecturing and IT facilities available, V1 will host the "talk talk" parts of the conference that require such facilities. Also, as there is an students' restaurant on the premises, all registered conference participants will be able to have their lunch here at very popular price.</p>
      <p>V2, on the other hand, is the fabulous multisport training and competition campus, and will hence host all "practical" parts of the program, including athletics (and other) competitions and practical workshops that require athletics track. It will also host the Zadar SporTech Expo international exhibition of technologies in sport, and all athtech companies that register for the AthTech conference will be able to showcase their products and services there at a discount exhibition price.</p>
      <p>The two are just about 1km away from each other, which is about 15 minutes stroll.</p>

      <h4>Accomodation</h4>
      <p>We currently have two hotels as partners of the Zadar SporTech Fest event, which are also welcoming the AthTech conference participants:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Hotel Kolovare <a href="https://hotel-kolovare.com/hr/">(website)</a></li>
        <li>Zaton Holiday Resort <a href="https://www.zaton.hr">(website)</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>Hotel Kolovare, freshly renovated last year, is located in Zadar, 1km from the Zadar University New Campus and 2km from the Višnjik Sports Center. Actually, Uni Capus is actually right halfway between Hotel Kolovare and Višnjik so you can easily get between all three on foot, or you can take a cab or even public transport.</p>
      <p>Zaton Holiday Resort is a luxury holiday resort slightly outside Zadar, about 13km from Višnjik. There will be a regular shuttle bus between Zaton and Višnjik so it will be as convenient for the participants of AthTech as being accommodated in downtown Zadar itself.</p>
